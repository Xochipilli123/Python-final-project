# Python-final-project
A repository related to my final project in my intro to python class

# Acknowledgements
I would like to thank Konstantinos P.Ferentinos and Oluwafemi Tairu for being my inspiration in creating a plant disease deep learning model, as well as Martin Skarzynski and the Biof309 class

# Purpose
The purpose of this project is to learn from previous plant pathology disease models and create my own, optimizing it using tools learned from the  Biof309 class. My goal is to continue to work on this project after the semester is over and try using different datasets. My model uses a convolutional neural network (using Keras) to train and the PlantVillage dataset (available in Kaggle and GitHub. Git Clone in my repo)
